# Bio
I’m a South Brazilian economist of full-blooded Yonsei heritage with a graduate specialization in Financial Management and Control and a master's degree in Applied Mathematics. This means that I am a "man without charm" (Unger, M.) currently living among the most charming people of our beautiful Rio de Janeiro-RJ of mixed cultures, ethnicities, and walks of life.

I majored in Economics (Political Economy and Crisis Theory), but 70% of my work is related to Management Accounting: UFPR may deserve an apology, just like [**"When Steindl met Kalecki."**](https://kurt-rothschild.at/downloads/Guger_Walterskirchen.pdf)
